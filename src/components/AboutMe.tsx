					I'm Felipe Saff, I'm 27 year old and I live in Cuiab√°, Brazil. I
					started to learn about software development in 2020. In that time, I
					was studying nutrition at the Federal University of Mato Grosso and I
					fell in love for development that I dropped out the course to focus on
					programming. Since then, I've been learning about programming every
					day at personal projects and my job. I have experience in some
					technologies, like: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Angular and PHP.
